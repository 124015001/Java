# Introduction to Java

Java is a popular Object Oriented Programming language which is used to make a secure and strong applications and also it runs across multiple operating systems.
The Java programming language was developed by _James Gosling_ and _Patrick Naughton_ for _Sun Microsystems Inc._ in 1991 and later purchased by _Oracle Corporation_.
Java is both a programming language as well as a platform. It offers more flexibility, maintainability and stability.

## Byte Code

Mostly, computer programs are platform dependent _i.e.,_ they are dependent to that specific hardware or the operating system that they run on. 
On the other hand, Java applications are independent of the platform they run on _i.e.,_ they are absolutely not affected with the changing platforms.
The problem of platform independence of Java is solved by **byte code**. <br>
<br>
Contrary to ordinary compilers, Java compiler does not produce _native executable code_. Instead it produces **_byte code_**. The Java Byte Code is a 
machine instruction for a Java processor chip called **_Java Virtual Machine(JVM)_**. The byte code is independent of the computer system it has to run upon.
