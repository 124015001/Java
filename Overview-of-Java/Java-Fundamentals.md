# Java Fundamentals

Let's see the building blocks of Java programming language. <br>
<br>
## Java Variables

In java there are different types of variables, like:
- **int**: stores interger without decimals.
- **float**: stores floating point numbers with decimal.
- **boolean**: stores either _true_ or _false_.
- **char**: stores single character with single quotes('').
- **String**: stores set of characters or a text with double quotes(" ").


## Java Identifiers

Identifiers are generally the names given by the programmer to different units of program in Java. They are the names of variables,methods,classes,etc.
<br>
Basic rules for forming identifier:
- They must not begin with a digit.
- Java is case-sensitive.
- They must not be a null or a boolean literal.
- They can contain alphabets,digits, _, $, etc.

## Java Keywords
  
 Keywords are reserved words that carry a special meaning to the system compiler. These words cannot be used for normal identifier names.
 Some of the java keywords are listed below.

  Operators in Java are:
  - Unary 
  - Arithmetic 
  - Logical

  - Shift
  - Relational
  - Ternary
  - Assignment

 ## Java Expression
  
 An expression in Java is any valid combination of operators, constants and variables. It is legal combination of Java tokens.
 Java expression contains variables,literals, operators and method calls.
